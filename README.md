## Welcome to
## PHY 250: Introduction to General Purpose GPU Computation
## University of California Davis, Winter 2024


GPU computation is an extremely powerful tool; however, getting started can be a daunting 
task. The goal of this course is to provide a Very Friendly introduction to GPU computation. 
The course will cover the necessary skills for communicating with and writing executable code 
for your GPU using OpenCL.

## Course Outline:
1. C/C++ Fundamentals: copies, references and pointers; dynamic memory allocation; classes, 
class members and operator overloading.

2. Introduction to OpenCL (Open Computing Language): Host-device communication; compute units, 
work groups and work items; memory layout and address spaces. 

3. Performing Calculations on The GPU: Writing and executing kernels; basic OpenCL data types; 
built in and user defined functions; user defined data structures; OpenCL/GL image and sampler 
types.

4. **FUN!!!**
